Sim 1
Reads the files A and B and solves for the mesh currents in the three specified methods:
The inversion method, Gauss elimination method (with partial pivoting), and Guass-Seidel method -
run 4 times, each to a different error acceptance (1%, 0.5%, 0.1%, 0.01%)

Sim 2

Sim 3
Plots regression lines for given file data using polynomial regressio of 3 different degrees,
exponential, and saturation-growth-rate regressions

Sim 4
Calculates the derivative at a certain point on a plotted regression line using the CDD method,
or the integral between two points on the plotted regression line using the trapezoid rule
